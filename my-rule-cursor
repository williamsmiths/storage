PROMPT FILE: Comprehensive Setup for Project Documentation and Rules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Luôn chỉ trả lời trong chat với người dùng là tiếng việt, nhưng trong code, rule thì luôn là tiếng anh**
**Overall Objective:**
To set up a specific directory structure for project documentation and internal AI rules (`.cursor/rules`), populate initial rule files with content from provided URLs, create new empty documentation files, and then guide the AI to customize the rule files according to the current project's context.
**Crucial Guiding Principle: At no point should any existing code files within this project be modified. All operations are strictly limited to creating or modifying the specified documentation and `.cursor` rule files.**

---
**PART 1: Initial Directory and File Creation**
---

---
**Step 1: Create the root `.cursor` directory**
---

Please create a directory named ".cursor" (with a leading dot) in the project's root directory.
After creating it, please confirm that the ".cursor" directory exists.

*(Wait for confirmation before proceeding)*

---
**Step 2: Create the `rules` subdirectory**
---

Inside the ".cursor" directory you just created, please create a subdirectory named "rules".
After creating it, please confirm that the ".cursor/rules" directory exists.

*(Wait for confirmation before proceeding)*

---
**Step 3: download file and rename `overview.mdc` and verify content**
---

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamsmiths/storage/refs/heads/main/001_cursor_rules_QreOi6xrlGY/overview-example.md

After creating the file and writing its content, please confirm that ".cursor/rules/overview.mdc" is NOT EMPTY and show me the first few lines of its content.

*(Wait for confirmation and content snippet before proceeding)*

---
**Step 4: Inside the ".cursor/rules" directory, please download file and rename `break-down-rule.mdc` and verify content**
---

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamsmiths/storage/dedcbb5d2e55270c7908de513b9bfa82162dbeda/001_cursor_rules_QreOi6xrlGY/break-down-rule.md

After creating the file and writing its content, please confirm that ".cursor/rules/break-down-rule.mdc" is NOT EMPTY and show me the first few lines of its content.

*(Wait for confirmation and content snippet before proceeding)*

---
**Step 5: Inside the ".cursor/rules" directory, please download file and rename `implementation-rule.mdc` and verify content**
---
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamsmiths/storage/refs/heads/main/001_cursor_rules_QreOi6xrlGY/implementation-rule.md

After creating the file and writing its content, please confirm that ".cursor/rules/implementation-rule.mdc" is NOT EMPTY and show me the first few lines of its content.

*(Wait for confirmation and content snippet before proceeding)*

---
**Step 6: Inside the ".cursor/rules" directory, please download file and rename `technical-design-documentation_rule.mdc` and verify content**
---

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamsmiths/storage/dedcbb5d2e55270c7908de513b9bfa82162dbeda/001_cursor_rules_QreOi6xrlGY/technical-design-documentation_rule.md

After creating the file and writing its content, please confirm that ".cursor/rules/technical-design-documentation_rule.mdc" is NOT EMPTY and show me the first few lines of its content.


*hãy kiểm tra lại các file trong .cursor/rules đã đủ chưa, nếu thiêu file nào thì tải lại file đó rồi tiếp tục*
*(Wait for confirmation and content snippet before proceeding)*

---
**Step 7: Create new documentation directory and `cms_ttd.md` file**
---

Please create the directory structure `./documentations/feature/` if it doesn't already exist in the project root.
Then, create an empty file named `cms_ttd.md` inside the `./documentations/feature/` directory.
Confirm that the file `./documentations/feature/cms_ttd.md` has been created.

*(Wait for confirmation before proceeding)*

---
**Step 8: Create new documentation directory and `cms_tasks.md` file**
---

Please create the directory structure `./documentations/task/` if it doesn't already exist in the project root.
Then, create an empty file named `cms_tasks.md` inside the `./documentations/task/` directory.
Then, create an empty file named `setting_tasks.md` inside the `./documentations/task/` directory.
Confirm that the file `./documentations/task/setting_tasks.md` has been created.

*(Wait for confirmation before proceeding. At this point, all initial file/directory creation should be complete.)*

**PART 2: Customizing `.cursor/rules` Files for the Current Project**
---
**Hãy đọc cấu trúc project hiện tại ở ./ và thực hiện các yêu cầu bên dưới đây hãy tự trả lời các câu hỏi và thực hiện**

**(This part should only be executed after all files in PART 1 have been successfully created and populated as specified.)**

Now, please revise the content of the files within the ".cursor/rules" directory based on the specifics of this current project.
**Remember the guiding principle: Do NOT modify any existing project code files. These changes apply ONLY to the files within `.cursor/rules`.** These files will serve as critical context and guidelines for our AI-assisted development workflows within this project.

1.  **For the `.cursor/rules/overview.mdc` file:**
    Please act as a Senior [Specify Current Project Language, e.g., Go, Python, TypeScript] Developer. You have over 20 years of experience in architecting large-scale, maintainable applications, particularly with [If Go, keep 'Go applications' and 'database interactions'. If other language, adapt to '[Project Language] applications' and relevant specializations, e.g., 'web services' or 'data processing pipelines'] and complex database interactions. Your primary goal for this task is to customize the `.cursor/rules` files to be highly specific and effective for the current project, drawing upon your extensive experience.
    Update its content to provide a comprehensive, architect-level overview of *this current project*. This should include:
    *   A general project description, its primary goals, and the core problems it solves.
    *   The main directory structure of *this current project* (list key folders, their purpose, and how they interact at a high level).
    *   Key technologies, frameworks, libraries, and architectural patterns currently being used in *this current project*. Explain *why* these choices were made if relevant.

2.  **For the other rule files in `.cursor/rules` (`break-down-rule.mdc`, `implementation-rule.mdc`, `technical-design-documentation_rule.mdc`):**
    Adapt their existing content (which was fetched from generic examples or previous iterations) to reflect the specific guidelines, standards, and processes relevant to *this current project*, consistent with best practices for large-scale, maintainable systems. Ensure their content aligns with how tasks are broken down, how implementation should proceed (including coding standards, testing strategies, and review processes), and how technical design documentation is structured and maintained *for this specific project*.
    For example:
    *   `.cursor/rules/break-down-rule.mdc` should detail how to break down features/epics into manageable tasks for *this* project, considering its agile workflow, team structure, and the need for clear deliverables and estimations. Emphasize a clear Definition of Done.
    *   `.cursor/rules/implementation-rule.mdc` should outline coding standards (e.g., naming conventions, error handling, logging), best practices for [Project Language], testing requirements (unit, integration, e2e), PR/MR (Pull Request/Merge Request) guidelines, and any specific CI/CD considerations relevant to *this* project's technology stack and architecture.
    *   `.cursor/rules/technical-design-documentation_rule.mdc` should define the template (e.g., ADRs - Architecture Decision Records, standard design doc sections), required sections, expected level of detail (balancing thoroughness with conciseness), and the review/approval process for technical design documents specifically used in *this* project.

Please make these changes directly in the respective files within the ".cursor/rules" directory. When rewriting the `break-down-rule.mdc`, `implementation-rule.mdc`, and `technical-design-documentation_rule.mdc` files to suit the current project, please base the revisions on the existing content within those files. After you have completed all the above steps, please list a checklist of the tasks performed in the file `./documentations/task/setting_tasks.md`.

Upon completion, please confirm.

---
**Final Check:**
Please confirm that all requested directories and files (`.cursor/rules/*`, `./documentations/feature/cms_ttd.md`, `./documentations/task/cms_tasks.md`) exist and that the `.cursor/rules` files have been updated according to the project-specific instructions, without altering any other project code.
